# Dynamic-Carpark-Pricing

Developed a data-driven dynamic pricing model to address car park congestion in urban areas, particularly during peak hours. The model aims to:

Optimize space usage by predicting real-time demand fluctuations.
Enhance revenue generation through dynamic price adjustments.
Improve user experience by minimizing overcrowding and reducing underutilization.
This solution aligns with smart city initiatives, contributing to more efficient urban planning, traffic management, and sustainability efforts. The project showcases expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and urban mobility solutions.
